DMX input/output controller based on Arduino-MEGA board. 
Accepts control sequences via the Ethernet port and provides:
1) the issuance of appropriate commands to DMX devices;
2) the transit of commands to DMX devices from the DMX input to the output with the possibility of changing channel numbers.
